# auditd Cookbook

[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/auditd.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/auditd)

A simple cookbook to install auditd and provided rulesets. Rulesets included in the OS auditd/audit package as examples are based on 4 established standards:

- [Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP)](http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/capp.pdf)
- [Labeled Security Protection Profile (LSPP)](http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/lspp.pdf)
- [National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)](http://www.fas.org/sgp/library/nispom.htm)
- [Security Technical Implementation Guides](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/stig/index.html)

The OS package provides the client side tools for working with the linux kernel audit framework.

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Debian/Ubuntu
- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle 6+

### Chef

- Chef 12.1+

### Cookbooks

- none

## Attributes

- node['auditd']['ruleset'] - ruleset to use, either "default" (the default if unset) or one of the provided examples
- node['auditd']['backlog'] - backlog size, default is 320 should be larger for busy systems
- node['auditd']['additional_lines'] - (array of strings) enables the addition of extra lines to the rendered ERB template that you may wish to include as well as those in the selected rulebase.

# Usage

If you're using one of the default rulesets set the correct attribute based on the ruleset desired, one of:

- "capp" : Controlled Access Protection Profile
- "lspp" : Labeled Security Protection Profile
- "nispom" : National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)
- "stig" : Security Technical Implementation Guides
- "cis" : Center for Internet Security auditd recommendations

And include `recipe[auditd::rules]` in your run list. You can also set the attribute `node['auditd']['ruleset']` to the name of a custom rule template to be used instead of one of the default rules.

If you are using the recipe from a wrapper cookbook, include the default recipe `recipe[auditd]` to setup the service and use the `auditd_ruleset` resource to place your rule template of choice.

If you are not satisfied with any of the provided templates, you can specify the `cookbook` attribute in `auditd_ruleset` to use your own set of rules. In this case, do not include `recipe[auditd::rules]`.

Use the `auditd::remove` recipe to uninstall auditd.
